# striprtf: Extract Text from RTF (Rich Text Format) File


## Installation

This package is currently not on CRAN.


Install development version from Github using `devtools` library.
```R
devtools::install_github("kota7/striprtf")
```


## Usage

The package exports only two functions: 
- `read_rtf` takes a path to an Rich Text Format (RTF) file and extracts plain text out of it.
- `strip_rtf` does the same by taking string instead of file path.

```{r}
library(striprtf)
x <- read_rtf(system.file("extdata/king.rtf", package = "striprtf"))
head(x)
```

The package has also been tested with documents in East Asian languages.
```{r}
read_rtf(system.file("extdata/amenimo.rtf", package = "striprtf"))
read_rtf(system.file("extdata/mean.rtf", package = "striprtf"))
```


## References

The algorithm employed has been mainly discussed in a stack overflow thread
(http://stackoverflow.com/a/188877) and later refactored and implemented 
by Gilson Filho for python 3 (https://gist.github.com/gilsondev/7c1d2d753ddb522e7bc22511cfb08676).
